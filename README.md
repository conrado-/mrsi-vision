## üí° Synopsis

An automated advanced manufacturing equipment attaches a lens on an optical engine (a PCB with microelectronics that drives a laser).

The equipment accepts a tray of optical engines with attached lens. The machine takes 8 pictures of the attached lens at various angles and compares them against a reference after the process. The machine assigns a score (from 0 to 100) based on the slight variances in measurements between the actual image and reference. The higher the score, the closer the result is to the desired specifications. The MRSI_VISION.log file stores these results.

The events column of the "human-parsed-log.xlsx" contains the image and the results of its score. Each image file name represents a unique "measurement". So 8 unique measurements (images) and their resulting scores. Each series in the chart plot its own measurement. The catch is that, an engineer can update the set of 8 images when a batch is done. (Meaning, a given set of 8 will be in effect for a period of time than another 8 might be introduced in the log. You can distinguish this change by time increments).

Each image-set/series can simply be labelled using their image filenames but you can refer to the ‚Äúfilename-mappings.csv‚Äù to map them to nice names.

This solution works as follow:
* Upload a log file  onto a web service/app.
* Parse and extract the scores from the raw log file.
* Generates a visualization that plots the scores onto a time series graph.

## üíæ Installation

```bash
	npm install
```
## ‚öôÔ∏è Execution

```bash
	node bin/www
```
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

* In Google Chrome open: http://localhost:3000.
* Choose test data file "MRSI_VISION.LOG" located in the doc folder.
* Click the Upload button.
